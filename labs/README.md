labs
=========
Each lab is a component that is deployed to an environment. If you do not have an environment, [spin one up](../infrastructure/aws/README.md).

The following labs are currently supported:

- [Apache Mesos](mesosmaster/README.md)
- [Apache Kafka](kafka/README.md)
- [Apache Zookeeper](zookeeper/README.md)
- [Cloudera Hadoop](clouderahadoop)
- [Golang Kafka Consumer](gokafkaconsumer)
- [GOlang Kafka Producer](gokafkaproducer)
